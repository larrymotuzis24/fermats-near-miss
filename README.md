# Fermat Near Misses (HW1) — Starter Template

This is a **minimal repository scaffold** for the HW1 project. There is **no application code** yet.
Use this as a clean starting point with your partner.

## Repo layout
```
.
├─ src/          # put your source files here
├─ tests/        # tests go here
├─ README.md     # update with run instructions once code exists
└─ .gitignore
```

## Getting started
1. Add your names/emails and course/section below.
2. Create an initial issue and assign tasks (e.g., input validation, nth-root helper, search loop).
3. Implement code in `src/` and tests in `tests/`.
4. Commit early, commit often.

## Team
- Student 1: _Name_ — _Email_
- Student 2: _Name_ — _Email_
Course/Section: _e.g., CPSC-XXX-YY_

## License
