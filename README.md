# Looking for Fermat’s Last Theorem Near Misses

## What this program does
Given n (3–11) and k (≥10), the program searches all (x, y) in [10..k] for the
smallest relative near miss to (x^n + y^n = z^n). It prints each new best near miss
and ends with the best overall, with clearly labeled values.

## How to run (Python)
python3 src/main.py
